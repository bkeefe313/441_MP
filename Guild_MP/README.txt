A3 - The Cabin in The Woods

This program has a car as my character, that can be driven
around with WASD and an ArcBall camera that follows the car
at all times.

WASD is used for movement. Left mouse button is used to
drag the camera around and orbit the car. Space is used to
zoom in and Left Shift + Space is used to zoom out.

You compile this code as normal.

This lab took me way too long. At least 5 hours as I struggled
to figure out how to make the camera follow the vehicle.

The labs kind of helped with the idea behind the shaders and
the modeling. 7/10

This lab was fun though, despite making me frustrated at times.
