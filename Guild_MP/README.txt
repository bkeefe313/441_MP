Midterm Project - The Fellowship

Project Description:
This is a program that renders our characters in a 3D environment.
The user can move the camera around the scene and interact with the characters.
The user can also change the camera to an arcball camera, a free famera, and toggle
a first person picture in picture display. The lighting method implemented in this program is
the Phong Reflectance Model using Gouraud Shading.

Character Controls:
W - Move Forward
S - Move Backward
A - Move Left
D - Move Right

Changing Characters:
1 - Change to Arthur Leywin (Default)
2 - Change to Clutch Norris
3 - Change to Saul Goodman

Changing Camera:
4 - Toggle Between Arcball Camera and Free Camera
5 - Toggle First Person Picture in Picture Display

Camera Controls:
Space - Zoom In
Shift + Space - Zoom Out
Left Mouse Button - Rotate Camera
If Free Camera is on:
    Up Arrow - Turn Camera Up
    Down Arrow - Turn Camera Down
    Left Arrow - Turn Camera Left
    Right Arrow - Turn Camera Right
    (Same zooming and rotation controls as Arcball Camera)

Compiling:
We used what was given to us in the labs. We created the necessary camera
classes and they are listed in the CMakeLists.txt file.

NEW: A rough distribution of responsibilities / contributions of each student
Everyone worked on the project together. We all contributed to the code and
most of the work was done using pair programming or CLion's Code With Me feature.
