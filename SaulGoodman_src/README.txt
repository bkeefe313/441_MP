Ben Keefe / Saul Goodman
A3 / The Cabin in the Woods

This program allows you to control saul goodman in a small scene. Move around with W/A/S/D and look around by holding left mouse button and dragging. Saul will move in the direction you are looking.
You can zoom with LShift+LMouse+drag mouse or with up and down arrow keys
Watch out! Jerma985 is following you around the scene. Don't worry about how freaky he is, he's just a streamer with a weird fanbase that photoshops his face into things like this.
Also, take a look at Los Pollos Hermanos, beloved restaurant owned by the late Gustavo Fring, of Breaking Bad.

Compilation requires all model files (all in the /models folder) and the shaders (/shaders folder). There should be no issues.
I will say, window sometimes goes black for (apparently) no reason on launch. Most of the time it works fine, though.

This took me maybe ~8 non consecutive hours? Not sure, I dumped a lot of time into debugging, model importing, etc.

Labs were absolutely vital to my ability to do this assignment, 10/10

9/10, really fun one. I loved being able to bring in models and mess around knowing how all this works.
